    <p>Thanks for your interest in my coding work. This section is divided into two parts: <a href="#projects">coding projects</a>, which represent larger pieces of work, and <a href="#samples">coding samples</a>, which are my solutions to coding exercises and challenges that I have found on the web.</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">Title</span><span class="galleryTitle"><a href="http://www.languagelearning.ninja/">LanguageLearning.Ninja</a></span></p>
        <a href="http://www.languagelearning.ninja/"><img src="images/lln-header.png" class="topGraphic"></a>
        <p><span class="highlight">What</span>Language Learning Ninja is a website that teaches foreign languages, and currently includes Danish, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. The website is divided into modules that allow users to learn using traditional methods such as flash cards, to learn through games, and to explore texts written in the language that they are learning. As users interact with the language they are learning their progress is saved to their profile, and content is generated for them based on spaced repetition algorithms that I have designed.</p>
        <p>A particular challenge with this project has been to write code that is not restricted to predefined language pairs. Each language on the website combines with every other language (where translation work is complete), and I have designed each module and the database so that new languages can be added based on user interest.</p>

        <p class="subEntry"><span class="highlight">Module</span>Flash cards</p>
        <img src="images/lln-flashcardvocab.png" class="topGraphic">
        <p>A popular method for learning new vocabulary is through flashcards. A word is shown and the user must correctly translate it.</p>
        <p>This version of vocabulary flashcards is slightly different from most flash card systems. Most systems translate in both directions, requiring users to both recognise and produce a word. Most systems also display just the word that needs to be translated in isolation. My version only requires users to translate into the target language, because if users are able to produce a word then they should be able to recognise it, although the reverse is not always the case. This version also embeds the word that is to be translated into a sentence in the target language asking for a translation, so that if users are speaking in that language and they need to ask how to translate something they are already familiar with how to ask the question.</p>
        <p>A particular challenge with the flashcards was how the database stores a user's progress. The spaced repetition is based on which word the user needs to practice next, but the module asks a user to translate into that language, and a word might have several possible translations. To work around this problem, the spaced repetition code takes into account how well the user performed against expectations and against other possible correct answers.</p>

        <p class="subEntry"><span class="highlight">Module</span>Hangman</p>
        <img src="images/lln-hangman.png" class="topGraphic">
        <p>This module is the classic hangman game where players must guess a mystery word by suggesting letters that might be contained within it. In this version the word that players must guess is taken from the language that they are learning. The translation of the word is displayed as a hint below. As players guess letters the corresponding button changes colour to show progress; alphabets are specific to the language being learned. Correct guesses are added to the puzzle and incorrect answers cost a life and update the game graphic.</p>
        <p>When a player completes the game, with either a loss or a victory, the spaced repetition code evaluates how well they performed and increases or decreases the time until the word is seen again accordingly.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><span class="highlight">What</span><span class="galleryTitle">Fizz Buzz</span> is a counting game. Players begin counting at 1, and move around the circle, increasing the count with each player. In every game there are two special numbers, representing "fizz" and "buzz". If the number the player is up to is divisible by this number, the player must say "fizz" or "buzz" respectively. If the number is divisible by both, the player must say "fizz buzz".
        <br>For example, if "fizz" is 3 and "buzz" is 5, players would count: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, etc.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Language</span>JavaScript</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">How</span>Here is my solution to the challenge.</p>
        <pre><code>
          <p>function fizzBuzz(fizz, buzz, end){
            <br>  var answer = [];
            <br>  for (var i = 1; i <= end; i++){
            <br>    if (i % fizz === 0 &amp;&amp; i % buzz === 0){
            <br>    answer.push(&quot;Fizz Buzz&quot;);
            <br>    } else if (i % fizz === 0){
            <br>    answer.push(&quot;Fizz&quot;);
            <br>    } else if (i % buzz === 0){
            <br>    answer.push(&quot;Buzz&quot;);
            <br>    } else {
            <br>    answer.push(i);
            <br>    }
            <br>  }
            <br>  console.log(answer.join(&quot;, &quot;));
            <br>  return answer;
            <br>}
          </p>
